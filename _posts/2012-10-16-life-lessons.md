*Note: The following article contains my own bullet-points and conclusions from the book “[Five Secrets you must discover before you die](http://amzn.com/1576754758)”. I recommend you read the book if you enjoyed this article.*

The lessons you must learn in life are:

1. Be true to yourself
2. Leave no regrets (risk)
3. Become love
4. Live the moment
5. Give more than you take

I’ll go over each lesson and elaborate it. Also, in the conclusion I’ll show you how to put these lessons into practice.

## 1. Be true to yourself
- Ask everyday if you’re living life at its fullest.
- Am I following my heart right now?
- Does this task, job, relationship, matter to me? If no, take actions to change it.

## 2. Leave no regrets (risk)
- You have a choice: Live in fear or focus on what you want and how to achieve it.
- Risk and regret are tied together.
- Because of the fear of rejection, failure, or uncertainty we die with our dreams unfulfilled, and our stories untold.
- Risk is a major contributor to greater fulfilment.
- Choose the path which will make the best story.

## 3. Become love
- There’s a fight going on between two wolves inside us: Evil wolf: anger, envy, greed, superiority, regret, fear, empty excuses. Good wolf: peace, love, hope, kindness, humility. Which wolf wins? The one you choose to feed.
- Act with love towards the closest to you. Make loving relationships. A Mercedes won’t come to visit you in hospital.
- Your checkbook is not your success — The people you meet and influence in your life will be your success.

## 4. Live the moment
- When you are young, 60 years seems like an eternity. But after you have lived them, they are but a moment.
- Don’t focus on the past or future; experience each moment.
- Judge your life less and enjoy it more.
- In order to live fully, you must banish the word “boring” from your dictionary.
- Live in the present; it’s the only moment in which we have any power over.

## 5. Give more than you take
- Tasks of a human life: to lose ourselves and to find ourselves.
- Losing ourselves is about seeing that we are connected to something much larger, something that had life before us (God, Nature). Yet we are significant because we are part of a larger entity.
- Finding ourselves is about discovering what we love, how to express ourselves, our own voice and calling.
- There’s no better way than to dedicate our life to giving and leaving the world a better place than we found it.
- If you are unhappy, get busy doing something for someone else. If you concentrate on yourself you will be unhappy, but if you focus on helping others you will find happiness. Happiness comes from serving and loving.
- Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of a generation.

## Putting the lessons into practice
- Knowing is not the problem, we have to put them into practice as well.
- Answers and experimentation: we pay attention and we try things. In the process, we constantly self-connect and refine until we achieve mastery.
- Knowing these lessons will not change your life, living them will.
- Greatest fear at the end of the life was not death but not having lived.
- What we fear at the end is great incompleteness — that we did not do what we were born to do.
- We must choose to live fully so that we don’t have any regrets at the end.
- Try to resist the temptation to judge your life. Rather, ask how I can embrace these secrets more deeply. The judging mind paralyses us by giving us a false sense of perfection or by giving us a deep sense of inadequacy.
