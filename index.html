    <p>I don&rsquo;t find myself defined by the work I&rsquo;ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do.</p>

    <p>I believe skills can be taught&mdash;personality is inherent. My personality is what separates me from others. Rather than getting awards, advancing status, or gaining accolades, I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do <a href="work" data-no-turbolink="true">interesting things</a> that matter.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m the cumulation of many skills and talents. I&rsquo;m wisdom, creativity, and experience. I&rsquo;m not a collection of hours. I&rsquo;ve stopped seeing myself as a per-hour commodity.</p>

    <p>I work with clients who want results and invest in their business in order to make it profitable. The value of what I do is based on the impact I can have on my client&rsquo;s business.</p>

    <p>I am currently <a href="mailto:&#097;&#108;&#101;&#120;&#064;&#097;&#108;&#101;&#120;&#099;&#105;&#099;&#097;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;" title="Email me">available for hire.</a></p>
